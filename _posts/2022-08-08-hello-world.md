Effectiv is building an AI-driven fraud and financial crime management platform for BFSI, starting with orchestration as the wedge.

In the past, BFSI enterprises have chosen best-of-breed point solutions for each element of the identity and event verification stacks, integrated via a central decision engine either developed in-house or delivered by an incumbent. These solutions are usually on-prem, with long deployment cycles. They prove challenging to maintain due to constant changes in underlying point solutions and decision times per case are often long, adversely affecting user experience. As BFSI moves online and the prevalence of fraud grows further, an intelligent, customizable, easy to configure + integrate + deploy decision engine is needed to combat new threats faster. This is critical for midsize BFSI cos and modern fintechs who can't afford long, complex deployments and would prefer to use a one-stop FDP SaaS with lower cost + complexity and higher agility.

Effectiv serves this segment with a next-gen orchestration platform/decision engine as the point of entry. Two key levers of differentiation v/s incumbents: (1) open architecture: integrates with existing point solutions and deploys custom ML models for client-specific fraud types and (2) intuitive, no-code, visual strategy designer + smart case management module, which enable significant productivity gains while reducing latency and false positive rates. With orchestration as the wedge, the company will develop the other point solutions in identity and event verification stacks to replace incumbents and become a one-stop shop. They are currently building full-fledged modules in fraud, credit, and compliance risk, including personal/commercial loan & card applications, credit underwriting, merchant onboarding, payments, etc.

Effectiv is founded by ex-Simility engineering/product leaders with rich experience in this space. Simility (Accel funded) was an online fraud detection engine that was acquired by Paypal. At Paypal this team built the merchant fraud platform. In the past year, the company has scaled to $625k CARR across 3 US customers and intends to close CY22 at >$1M ARR.
