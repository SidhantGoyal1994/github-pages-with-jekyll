Effectiv is building an AI-driven fraud and financial crime management platform for BFSI, starting with orchestration as the wedge.

In the past, BFSI enterprises have chosen best-of-breed point solutions for each element of the identity and event verification stacks, integrated via a central decision engine either developed in-house or delivered by an incumbent. These solutions are usually on-prem, with long deployment cycles. They prove challenging to maintain due to constant changes in underlying point solutions and decision times per case are often long, adversely affecting user experience. As BFSI moves online and the prevalence of fraud grows further, an intelligent, customizable, easy to configure + integrate + deploy decision engine is needed to combat new threats faster. This is critical for midsize BFSI cos and modern fintechs who can't afford long, complex deployments and would prefer to use a one-stop FDP SaaS with lower cost + complexity and higher agility.
